* Info

* Compilers
** gcc vs g++
gcc compiles c and C++ as per there extension but links against standard C libraries. 
By compiling with g++ program will link against std C++ libraries irresprice of file extension.
** Floating point
All source code should follow same floating point ABI. When mixing C and C++ I adjusted them.
* Libraries
** Standard libraries
Keil library documentation
A program which uses main causes inclusion of standard c library functions rt_lib_init
